- **Appointment Scheduling:**
  - Doctors can efficiently manage their appointments through the app.They can create,edit or delete their slots.
  - Patients can conveniently book appointments with their preferred doctors.
    
- **Notifications:**
  - Firebase messaging has been used to handle notifications
  - Patients get notifications for medication reminder and tracker reminder.

- **Emergency Response:**
  - Doctors can respond to emergencies promptly through the application.
  - Patients can request emergencies and get help from the doctor through messaing and video calling.

- **Medical History:**
  - Patients can securely store and access their medical reports within the app.
  - They can also share their reports and any stored files with their appointed doctor.

- **Health Condition Tracking:**
  - Users can keep a daily track of their health condition, enabling better healthcare management.
  - As of now we have implemented a kidney disease tracker.Which consists of :
    - Tracking water intake , urine condition , protein intake , weight measurement , blood pressure.
    - For protein calculation we have used nutritionix api to get protein value for different food.
      
- **Prescribing Medicines:**
  - Doctors can prescribe medicines to the patient during the appointment.
  - The medicine information was taken from a kaggle dataset which contained general medicine information of bangladeshi medicines.

- **Payment:**
  - We used SSLCOMMERZE sandbox to implement payment feature.
  - As of now it is still a dummy feature but in future we can use the original SSLCOMMERZE api and integrate it. 

- **Medication Reminders:**
  - Patients receive timely reminders for medications, ensuring adherence to prescribed treatments.
  - They can also generate PDF of all of their medicines.
  - Patients will be able to view the information of the prescribed medicine such as remaining days , time of intake etc.

- **Virtual Consultation:**
  - Patients can schedule online appointments with doctors, providing flexibility and convenience.
  - We have used AGORA video calling uikit to implement video calling feature.
  - This feature has also not been finalized.As we need to refresh the token each day for the free video calling feature from AGORA.
